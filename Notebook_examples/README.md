# Kinbiont Notebooks  

This folder contains some examples from the documentation, presented as compiled notebooks.  
The contents are as follows:  

- **CoC_DT/** Example of how to apply a decision tree to coculture data to analyze how interactions modify the kinetics of a strain. Applied to real data from *"Construction and Modeling of a Coculture Microplate for Real-Time Measurement of Microbial Interactions."*  
- **DT_examples/** Example of how to apply a decision tree to coculture data to study interactions between drugs (synthetic data).  
- **Fitting_examples/** Various examples of fitting time series with Kinbiont.jl.  
- **Simulation_examples/** Examples of time series simulations using Kinbiont.jl.  
- **SymR_examples/** Example of using symbolic regression to discover empirical unknown laws (synthetic data).
